1. I need to refresh my memory on how to use redux here. I did this in his epic
   react course a few months ago so I'll need to play around with React some
   more there and do some testing. Probably a great time to get back to my
   marvel snap helper!

Refer to
https://testingjavascript.com/lessons/react-test-a-redux-connected-react-component
for the video. There is a second video, but I'll call this module here for a
bit. I've no need for redux just yet
